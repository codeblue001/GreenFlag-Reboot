1. added android:screenOrientation="portrait" so that the screen maintains the portrait style orientation
2. add permission for camera intent
    <!--CAMERA INTENT PERMISSION-->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
3. Add recycle view dependency







ISSUES
#1 app is crashing upon hitting next on the main activity

Solution
#1 the reason was because of the use of view instead of View
